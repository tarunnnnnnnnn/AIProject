# AIProject
This project combines real-time weather data from a public API with AI-based predictive models to deliver accurate and dynamic weather forecasts. It fetches live meteorological data (such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) and uses machine learning algorithms to predict short-term and long-term weather trends.
